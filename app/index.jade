							.content
								p There’s a secret language that all women speak, that most men will never understand... But those few men who do, INSTANTLY fall into a different category of men in a womans mind.

								ul
									li How to use laughter (the universal bonding tool) to create a personal connection with a woman the moment you meet her
									li How to make every woman you meet think of you in a sexual way even without saying a word
									li The ability to communicate on a deeper level, <strong>create deeper connections and congruent attraction</strong>. You will <u>NOT</u> learn the terrible old “pickup tricks” that lowers a girls confidence.

								p You’re on a date with a woman and you want to kiss her… or you’re making out, and it’s time to “make the move”… but instead, You Choke. You crack. You buckle. You get freaked out by your fear and other emotions, and you blow it. Why?
								p The truth is, most men don’t have a clue on how to satisfy a woman in bed.
								ul
									li The Power of Erotic Hypnosis: How to make her come without even touching her. Sounds unbelievable right? Honestly, I didn’t believe this myself until I saw it with my own eyes(!)
									li Eliminate the dreaded “pre-mature ejaculation” syndrome so you can last longer and never again have to worry about coming too fast (this deeper level solution is easier than most people think)
									li Learn the natural way of Sensual Kissing and Touching that makes a woman so turned on she’s begging you to take her home.

								p
									| The Summit was an incredible experience that’s still flashing through my head. For two days we were in our own little bubble where there was no shyness or insecurity and everybody could talk together and become friends.
									| Just to be around people like Zan and Johnny where you can actually FEEL their presence was an amazing experience that completely shifted my perception on what’s possible in social interactions because I’ve never met people with that kind of charisma before. I’m already psyched about next year and I’d easily fight an old woman for it if that’s what it takes to get a ticket
									.name Mads Nor Lunde

								p 
									| The greatest value is not from speeches… it’s from the breaks. Meeting these incredible people, bith speaker and students, is what really is inspiring. That’s the real value!
									| My realization is that, they are real people. They are not Pick-Up artists trying to learn a line or two. They are genuinely worthy and caring people that want to improve their life in order to make the world a better place. Really!
									| People that come to these seminars are people that want to improve their lives, they are people that take their life seriously and fully immerse in it. I felt that I had known them for several years after talking to them for 10 minutes because we had so much in common. And because everyone is interested in connecting.
							
									| No one has hidden agendas, no one has uncovered needs, everyone is there to share value. I met some incredible People at the conference, including Jordan Harbinger, Bryan Bayer, Johnny Soporno, Violett Marcell, Tom Torrerro, Zan Perrion and many many others.
							
									| They are incredibly diverse individuals, but the thing they all have in common is this. They are People! They are true genuine people with their lives filled with:
							
									| Gratitude, Love, Passion and Freedom!

							h2 Frequently Asked questions

						.content
							h4 What can I expect at Morten Hake Summit?
							p If you’re expecting a traditional seminar, you’re in for a surprise! The Morten Hake Summit presents speakers who are PASSIONATE about giving you their most powerful training, profound mind shifts, groundbreaking ideas, and extensive knowledge to completely transform literally every part of your life.
							p Speakers are constantly walking around holding mini-workshops, intimate lessons and answering questions throughout the breaks and lunch-hours.
							p While you can still expect mind-blowing stage presentations from some of the top names in Dating, Sex, Relationships and Self-Development - the Summit you’ll connect with what we believe to be the most impactful group of extraordinary people within dating and personal development, who are driven to expand and immerse in their personal growth.
							p Expect to form new friendships, deep connections and re-boot your life with an extensive new network of friends on the same path as you.


							h4 How much are the tickets?
							p The Morten Hake Summit delivers a world-class transformational education from the the best in the world when it comes to live and act like a man with purpose.
							p I’ve literally spent over 5 years of my life reaching out to the REAL experts that walk the talk, becoming their friends, and persuading them to come to Norway for a FRACTION of the price you’d normally pay for their services.
							p Every day most people waste their time, energy and money on things and experiences that doesn’t enrich the quality of life and are easily forgotten a year from now.
							p Ask yourself: How much is it worth to you to become totally immersed in a 2 day world-class training by the worlds most insightful experts on dating and attraction?
							p Is it worth more than the clothes you wear and accessories you sport? Is it worth more than the cover charges and overpriced drinks you pay at your favorite bars or clubs?
							p Is it worth more than a few liters of gas or a few kilometers in a taxi? Is it worth more than wasting time living in the pity of your excuses when opportunity surrounds you?
							p The Morten Hake Summit is an investment in yourself as a man. What you pay for in dollars will be returned many times over to you in terms of better life experiences, increased satisfaction and happiness (and satisfaction and happiness for the women you meet)
							p You’ll never remember the measly $297 you invested, but one thing you’ll never forget is the day in your life when everything changed because you made the choice to live out your dreams and become the man you’ve always wanted to be.
							p Don’t let fear or uncertainty stop you from creating the lifestyle you want.
							p Secure your seat at the Morten Hake Summit.

							h4 Do you have a guarantee and/or refund policy?
							p Yes, of course! In the event you have something come up and can’t make it to the Morten Hake Summit, you will get a full refund through August 1st, and a 50% money-back refund if you notify us before August 15th. After that, you can send someone else in your place. You can email us at <a href="mailto:support@mortenhakesummit.com">support@mortenhakesummit.com</a> for questions on refunds.

							h4 What should I bring with me?
							p The most important thing is a positive attitude, an open-mind and the willingness to accept new ideas! A lot of the things you’re gonna discover may be counter-intuitive and even contradicting everything you’ve heard before! Trust the process, stay open-minded, and you’ll experience the fastest growth possible.
							p Other than that, don’t worry - we got you covered! At the entry you’ll receive a free gift-bag containing everything you need to get the most out of your experience.
