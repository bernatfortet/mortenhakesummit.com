                  The Summit was an incredible experience that’s still flashing through my head. For two days we were in our own little bubble where there was no shyness or insecurity and everybody could talk together and become friends.
                  Just to be around people like Zan and Johnny where you can actually FEEL their presence was an amazing experience that completely shifted my perception on what’s possible in social interactions because I’ve never met people with that kind of charisma before. I’m already psyched about next year and I’d easily fight an old woman for it if that’s what it takes to get a ticket

                  The greatest value is not from speeches… it’s from the breaks. Meeting these incredible people, bith speaker and students, is what really is inspiring. That’s the real value!
                  My realization is that, they are real people. They are not Pick-Up artists trying to learn a line or two. They are genuinely worthy and caring people that want to improve their life in order to make the world a better place. Really!
                  People that come to these seminars are people that want to improve their lives, they are people that take their life seriously and fully immerse in it. I felt that I had known them for several years after talking to them for 10 minutes because we had so much in common. And because everyone is interested in connecting.
                  No one has hidden agendas, no one has uncovered needs, everyone is there to share value. I met some incredible People at the conference, including Jordan Harbinger, Bryan Bayer, Johnny Soporno, Violett Marcell, Tom Torrerro, Zan Perrion and many many others.
                  They are incredibly diverse individuals, but the thing they all have in common is this. They are People! They are true genuine people with their lives filled with:
                  Gratitude, Love, Passion and Freedom!

            </header>
            <div class="content">
              <h4>How Much Does The Ticket Cost?</h4>
              <p>Your ticket for The Morten Hake Summit 4 costs $297. That’s if you buy before August 1st 2013. </p>
              <p>After that the price goes up to $397. Which is still a huge bargain.</p>
              <h4>What’s In The V.I.P. Package?</h4>
              <p>The V.I.P. package gets you front row seats for the conference. A T-shirt. An additional swag bag. But the most valuable part of the V.I.P. package is that you are invited to a private exclusive V.I.P. dinner with all the speakers. This dinner is where legendary stories are made. </p>
              <p>Not only will you have an incredibly fun time. You can ask the speakers anything you want. And have their full attention 1-on-1. These speakers charge thousands of dollars for coaching. But when you show up to the V.I.P. dinner, you can get all of your questions answered, right then and there by all of the speakers. </p>
              <h4>Is this conference for men? Or should women come too?</h4>
              <p>This conference is for everybody. Women should absolutely come. Every woman who has ever attended has loved it. The presentations give value to everyone, male or female. </p>
              <p>The Morten Hake Summit is about creating a better conversation between men and women. You  get incredible value from the speakers. And you will have a better understanding of yourself, and the men in your life. </p>
              <p>"What I love about this is that while Dating and Pickup is part of it, the real focus is personal growth and the insights that can really make a person feel fulfilled about themselves!" - Cecilie Jayer</p>
              <h4>Where is the conference being held? And at what time?</h4>
              <p>The conference is being held at the Kanonhallen. On August 31st - September 1st. </p>
              <p>Show starts at 10:00AM. You’ll want to show up a little early. There’s a quick break after each speaker. And a dinner break at 7:00PM. </p>
              <p>The conference is located at the Kanonhallen located at: Peter Møllersvei 2, 0585, Oslo</p>
              <h4>What can I expect at Morten Hake Summit?</h4>
              <p>If you’re expecting a traditional seminar, you’re in for a surprise! The Morten Hake Summit presents speakers who are PASSIONATE about giving you their most powerful training, profound mind shifts, groundbreaking ideas, and extensive knowledge to completely transform literally every part of your life.</p>
              <p>Speakers are constantly walking around holding mini-workshops, intimate lessons and answering questions throughout the breaks and lunch-hours.</p>
              <p>While you can still expect mind-blowing stage presentations from some of the top names in Dating, Sex, Relationships and Self-Development - the Summit you’ll connect with what we believe to be the most impactful group of extraordinary people within dating and personal development, who are driven to expand and immerse in their personal growth.</p>
              <p>Expect to form new friendships, deep connections and re-boot your life with an extensive new network of friends on the same path as you.</p>
              <h4>Do you have a guarantee and/or refund policy?</h4>
              <p>Yes, of course! In the event you have something come up and can’t make it to the Morten Hake Summit, you will get a full refund through August 1st, and a 50% money-back refund if you notify us before August 15th. After that, you can send someone else in your place. You can email us at support@mortenhakesummit.com for questions on refunds.</p>
              <h4>What should I bring with me?</h4>
              <p>The most important thing is a positive attitude, an open-mind and the willingness to accept new ideas! A lot of the things you’re gonna discover may be counter-intuitive and even contradicting everything you’ve heard before! Trust the process, stay open-minded, and you’ll experience the fastest growth possible.</p>
              <p>Other than that, don’t worry - we got you covered! At the entry you’ll receive a free gift-bag containing everything you need to get the most out of your experience.</p>
