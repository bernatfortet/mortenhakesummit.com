The greatest value is not from speeches… it’s from the breaks. Meeting these incredible people, bith speaker and students, is what really is inspiring. That’s the real value!
My realization is that, they are real people. They are not Pick-Up artists trying to learn a line or two. They are genuinely worthy and caring people that want to improve their life in order to make the world a better place. Really!
People that come to these seminars are people that want to improve their lives, they are people that take their life seriously and fully immerse in it. I felt that I had known them for several years after talking to them for 10 minutes because we had so much in common. And because everyone is interested in connecting.
No one has hidden agendas, no one has uncovered needs, everyone is there to share value. I met some incredible People at the conference, including Jordan Harbinger, Bryan Bayer, Johnny Soporno, Violett Marcell, Tom Torrerro, Zan Perrion and many many others.
They are incredibly diverse individuals, but the thing they all have in common is this. They are People! They are true genuine people with their lives filled with:
